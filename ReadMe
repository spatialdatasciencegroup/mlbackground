#Some important techniques in Machine Learning
Basic Statistics and Probability
1. Random variables
2. Distributions
3. Expectation, Variance, variable replacement
3. Maximum Likelihood Method
4. Hypothesis testing, p-value

Machine Learning
1. Max Likelihood, least mean square loss
2. Expectation Maximization (EM)
3. Variational Inference -> Variational Auto-encoder, Normalizing Flow, Invertible Neural Network
4. Probabilistic Graphical Model: message propagation, marginlization
5. Gradient descent (stochastic gradient descent), Chain rule
6. Convex optimization
